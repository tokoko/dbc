# Finding Drivers

You can list the available drivers by running `dbc search`:

<!-- dbc-output: search -->
```console
$ dbc search
bigquery             An ADBC driver for Google BigQuery developed by the ADBC Driver Foundry
chdb                 An embedded ADBC driver powered by ClickHouse

datafusion           An ADBC driver for Apache DataFusion developed by the ADBC Driver Foundry
duckdb               An ADBC driver for DuckDB developed by the DuckDB Foundation
exasol               An ADBC driver for Exasol developed by Exasol Labs
flightsql            An ADBC driver for Apache Arrow Flight SQL developed under the Apache Software Foundation
mssql                An ADBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server developed by Columnar

oracle     [private] An ADBC driver for Oracle Database developed by Columnar
teradata   [private] An ADBC driver for Teradata developed by Columnar
```
<!-- /dbc-output -->

!!! note

    The drivers listed above with the  `[private]` label require a license to use. See [Private Drivers](./private_drivers.md) to learn how to use these drivers.

## Finding a Specific Driver

You can filter the list of drivers by a pattern.
The pattern is treated as a regular expression using Go's [regexp/syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax) syntax and is tested against both the name and the description of the driver.

For example, you can find drivers with 'sql' in their name by running,

<!-- dbc-output: search sql -->
```console
$ dbc search sql
flightsql  An ADBC driver for Apache Arrow Flight SQL developed under the Apache Software Foundation
mssql      An ADBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server developed by Columnar
mysql      An ADBC Driver for MySQL developed by the ADBC Driver Foundry
postgresql An ADBC driver for PostgreSQL developed under the Apache Software Foundation
sqlite     An ADBC driver for SQLite developed under the Apache Software Foundation
```
<!-- /dbc-output -->

## Private Drivers

If you are [logged in](./private_drivers.md) to a private registry, you will see some drivers marked with a `[private]` label:

```console
$ dbc search
...
oracle   [private] An ADBC driver for Oracle Database developed by Columnar
```

These drivers can be [installed](./installing.md) and added to [driver lists](../concepts/driver_list.md) just like regular drivers.

## Options

### Verbose

You can use the `--verbose` flag to show detailed information about each driver, including all versions that are available and which are installed.

<!-- dbc-output: search --verbose -->
```console
$ dbc search --verbose

### Pre-release Versions

{{ since_version('v0.2.0') }}

By default, `dbc search` hides pre-release versions from search results. Pre-release versions follow semantic versioning conventions and include version identifiers like `1.0.0-alpha.1`, `2.0.0-beta.3`, or `1.5.0-rc.1`.

To include pre-release versions in search results, use the `--pre` flag:

```console
$ dbc search --pre
```

Without `--pre`, `dbc search` will:

- Hide drivers that have exclusively pre-release versions (no stable versions), unless the driver is already installed
- Exclude pre-release versions from the available versions list

With `--pre`, `dbc search` will:

- Show drivers even if they have exclusively pre-release versions
- Include pre-release versions in the available versions list when using `--verbose`

For example, with `--pre --verbose`:

<!-- dbc-output: search --pre --verbose mysql -->
```console
$ dbc search --pre --verbose mysql
• mysql
   Title: ADBC Driver Foundry Driver for MySQL
   Description: An ADBC Driver for MySQL developed by the ADBC Driver Foundry
   License: Apache-2.0
   Available Versions:
    ├── 0.1.0
    ├── 0.2.0
    ├── 0.3.0
    ├── 0.3.1
    ├── 0.4.0
    ├── 0.5.0
    ╰── 0.6.0
```
<!-- /dbc-output -->

!!! note
    Using the `--pre` flag with `dbc search` only affects the visibility of pre-release versions in search results. To actually install a pre-release version, you need to either use `--pre` with `dbc install` or use a version constraint that unambiguously references a pre-release (by including a pre-release suffix like `-beta.1`).
