# Installing Drivers

Once you've [installed dbc](../getting_started/installation.md), the first thing you'll probably want to do is install a [driver](../concepts/driver.md).
But before you can install a driver, you need to know what drivers are available and how to refer to them.

## Finding a Driver

To find out what [drivers](../concepts/driver.md) are available, use [`dbc search`](../reference/cli.md#search). For more details, see the [Finding Drivers](./finding_drivers.md) guide:

<!-- dbc-output: search -->
```console

```
<!-- /dbc-output -->

The short names in lowercase on the left of the output are the names you need to pass to [`dbc install`](../reference/cli.md#install). These drivers are available from Columnar's [driver registry](../concepts/driver_registry.md).

!!! note

    The drivers listed above with the `[private]` label require a license to use. See [Private Drivers](./private_drivers.md) to learn how to use these drivers.

## Installing a Driver

To install a specific driver, such as `mysql`, run:

```console
$ dbc install mysql
[✓] searching
[✓] downloading
[✓] installing
[✓] verifying signature

Installed mysql 0.1.0 to /Users/user/Library/Application Support/ADBC/Drivers
```

To confirm the driver is installed, run [`dbc list`](../reference/cli.md#list):

```console
$ dbc list
DRIVER  VERSION  LEVEL  LOCATION

mysql   0.1.0    user   /Users/user/Library/Application Support/ADBC/Drivers
```

## Version Constraints

By default, dbc installs the latest version of the package you specify.
To install a specific version, you can pass a version constraint with the name:

```console
$ dbc install "mysql=0.1.0"
```

The syntax for specifying a version may be familiar to you if you've used other package managers.

!!! note
    dbc uses the [github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3#section-readme) package whose README has a good overview of the syntax it allows. In short, you can use `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `~`, `^`, ranges like `1.2 - 1.4.5`, and wildcards (`x`, `X`, or `*`).

## Pre-release Versions

{{ since_version('v0.2.0') }}

### Allowing Pre-release Versions

By default, dbc acts as if pre-release versions don't exist when searching for and installing drivers. Pre-release versions follow semantic versioning conventions and include version identifiers like `1.0.0-alpha.1`, `2.0.0-beta.3`, or `1.5.0-rc.1`.

To allow dbc to install a pre-release version when it's the newest version available, use the `--pre` flag:

```console
$ dbc install --pre mysql
```

This will allow dbc to consider pre-release versions when selecting the latest version to install.

!!! note
    The `--pre` flag allows dbc to install a pre-release version when you didn't ask for it explicitly. Without `--pre`, your version constraint must contain a pre-release suffix (like `-beta.1`) for dbc to consider pre-release versions.

### Installing Specific Pre-release Versions

You can install a specific pre-release version without using the `--pre` flag if your version constraint unambiguously references a pre-release by including a pre-release suffix:

```console
$ dbc install "mysql=1.0.0-beta.1"
$ dbc install "mysql>=1.0.0-beta.1"
```

However, if your version constraint is ambiguous and only a pre-release version satisfies it, dbc will fail rather than install the pre-release. For example, if a driver has versions `0.1.0` and `0.1.1-beta.1`:

```console
$ dbc install "mysql>0.1.0"
# This will FAIL, not install 0.1.1-beta.1
```

To install `0.1.1-beta.1` in this case, you must either:

- Use `--pre`: `dbc install --pre "mysql>0.1.0"`
- Reference the pre-release explicitly: `dbc install "mysql>=0.1.1-beta.1"`

## Updating a Driver

dbc doesn't offer a specific "update" or "upgrade" command but `dbc install` can do essentially the same thing.

For example, if you were to run `dbc install mysql` and get version 0.1.0, if — at some point in the future — version 0.2.0 were to be released, re-running `dbc install mysql` would upgrade your installed version to 0.2.0.

!!! note

    When dbc updates a driver like this, the old driver is uninstalled first. [ADBC driver manifests](../concepts/driver_manifest.md) provide a mechanism to support having multiple versions of the same driver installed at the same time and dbc may provide a convenient way to do this in a future release.

## Installing System Wide

By default, dbc installs drivers to the standard user-level ADBC driver path suitable for your system:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ADBC/Drivers`
- Linux: `~/.config/adbc/drivers`
- Windows: `%LOCAL_APPDATA%\ADBC\Drivers`

Numerous dbc subcommands, including `install`, accept an optional `--level` flag which can used to install drivers system-wide. Note that we run this command with `sudo` because otherwise the directory may not be writable:

```console
$ sudo dbc install --level system mysql
[✓] searching
[✓] downloading
[✓] installing
[✓] verifying signature

Installed mysql 0.1.0 to /Library/Application Support/ADBC/Drivers
```

Where this installs depends on your operating system:

- macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ADBC/Drivers`
- Linux: `/etc/adbc/drivers`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\ADBC\Drivers`

!!! note

    See [Manifest Location and Discovery](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/format/driver_manifests.html#manifest-location-and-discovery) for complete documentation of where the [ADBC driver managers](../concepts/driver_manager.md) will search for [drivers](../concepts/driver.md). dbc has the same behavior.


!!! note

    Also see the [Config Level](../reference/config_level.md) reference for more detail on this behavior.

## `ADBC_DRIVER_PATH`

For complete control over where dbc installs drivers, set the `ADBC_DRIVER_PATH` environment variable to a path (or list of paths) where you want to install drivers.
For example:

```console
$ mkdir "$HOME/drivers"
$ export ADBC_DRIVER_PATH="$HOME/drivers"
$ dbc install mysql

[✓] searching
[✓] downloading
[✓] installing
[✓] verifying signature

Installed mysql 0.1.0 to /home/user/drivers

$ tree $ADBC_DRIVER_PATH
/home/user/drivers
├── mysql_linux_amd64_v0.1.0
│   ├── libadbc_driver_mysql.so
│   ├── libadbc_driver_mysql.so.sig
│   ├── LICENSE
│   └── NOTICE
└── mysql.toml

2 directories, 5 files
```

!!! note

    If you set `$ADBC_DRIVER_PATH` environment variable with dbc, you will also need to re-use the same shell or set it in your ADBC driver manager code explicitly. For example:

    ```python
    import os
    from pathlib import Path

    from adbc_driver_manager import dbapi

    os.environ["ADBC_DRIVER_PATH"] = str(Path.home() / "drivers")

    with dbapi.connect(driver="mysql") as con:
      pass
    ```

## Python Support

By default, dbc automatically detects whether you've activated a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and will install (and uninstall) drivers from the virtual environment rather than the user or system-level paths.

```console
~/tmp/my-adbc-project
$ python3 -m venv .venv

~/tmp/my-adbc-project
$ source .venv/bin/activate.fish

~/tmp/my-adbc-project
.venv $ dbc install mysql
[✓] searching
[✓] downloading
[✓] installing
[✓] verifying signature

Installed mysql 0.1.0 to /Users/user/tmp/my-adbc-project/.venv/etc/adbc/drivers
```

!!! note

    [`ADBC_DRIVER_PATH`](#adbc_driver_path) takes precedence over a virtual environment. dbc (and [ADBC driver managers](../concepts/driver_manager.md)) use the following precedence hierarchy: `ADBC_DRIVER_PATH` before virtual environments before Conda environments.

## Conda Support

By default, dbc automatically detects whether you've activated a [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) and will install (and uninstall) drivers from the Conda environment rather than the user or system-level paths.

```console
$ conda create -n my-adbc-project
$ conda activate my-adbc-project
my-adbc-project $ dbc install mysql
[✓] searching
[✓] downloading
[✓] installing
[✓] verifying signature

Installed mysql 0.1.0 to /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/envs/my-adbc-project/etc/adbc/drivers
```

!!! note

    [`ADBC_DRIVER_PATH`](#adbc_driver_path) and/or an activated Python virtual environment will take precedence over a Conda environment. dbc (and [ADBC driver managers](../concepts/driver_manager.md)) use the following precedence hierarchy: `ADBC_DRIVER_PATH` before virtual environments before Conda environments.

## From Local Archive

dbc can install drivers from local archives as an alternative for users who can't or don't want to install from a [Driver Registry](../concepts/driver_registry.md). This is meant for advanced use cases and requires understanding the [ADBC Driver Manifests](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/format/driver_manifests.html) spec and loading process.

To install from a local archive, pass the path to a local archive instead of a name and set the `--no-verify` flag to skip signature verification:

```console
$ dbc install --no-verify some_driver.tar.gz
Installing from local package: some_driver.tar.gz

[✓] installing
[-] verifying signature

Installed some_driver 1.0.0 to /Users/user/Library/Application Support/ADBC/Drivers
```

!!! note

    Make note of the name "some_driver" printed above as this will be the name to use when loading the driver with a [Driver Manager](../concepts/driver_manager.md). i.e., `dbapi.connect(driver="some_driver")`.

## GitHub Actions

To use dbc with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), we recommend the official [`columnar-tech/setup-dbc`](https://github.com/columnar-tech/setup-dbc) action. See the [Continuous Integration](./continuous_integration.md) guide for more detail and examples.

## Uninstalling Drivers

You can uninstall a driver with the `dbc uninstall` subcommand.

```console
$ dbc uninstall mysql

Driver `mysql` uninstalled successfully!
```

Similar to the install command, `dbc uninstall` takes a `--level` argument.
If, for example, you installed a driver with `--level system`, you would want also pass that argument to `dbc uninstall`:

```console
$ sudo dbc install --level system mysql
$ sudo dbc uninstall --level system mysql
```

Since it's possible to install the same driver to multiple locations, dbc will only uninstall the first driver it finds.
dbc will search in the following order:

1. Environment
    1. `ADBC_DRIVER_PATH`
    2. `VIRTUAL_ENV`
    3. `CONDA_PREFIX`
2. User
3. System
